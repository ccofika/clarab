02:41 AM | DusanMe from Stake.com: Hello there! 
 
 Thank you for reaching out, I will take it from here. 
 
 It would seem that your bet has been successfully settled as a loss. 
 
 Could you please elaborate as to what the issue seems to be?

02:44 AM | Triiicky: Confused how it is a loss if it literally on the red, zoomed in too

02:45 AM | Triiicky: Telling me it doesn’t land on the red there?

02:48 AM | DusanMe from Stake.com: Please note that this is simply visual on your side, and you can check your bets on Provably Fair. 
 
 You can read more about the topic in our Blog post "How does the provably fair system work?", here (https://stake.com/blog/how-does-the-provably-fair-system-work). 
 
 The system makes the outcome of all Stake Originals bets randomly generated, foolproof and verifiable so if there were any form of manipulation or wrong doing being done, it would be in public for anyone to prove.
﻿​﻿
﻿If you have issues with the legitimacy of the bet(s), you are free to verify them using the tool on our site (https://stake.com/provably-fair/calculation) or other third-party websites offering validation tools such as ProvablyFair.me (https://www.provablyfair.me/casino/stake-verifier/). 
 
 Note that the features above only pertain to Stake Original games (https://stake.com/casino/group/stake-originals). Third-party slot games don't use this system and are not handled by Stake directly. They are entirely handled by the providers themselves, and we merely offer them on our platform on their behalf. However, they are still massively popular worldwide which should attest to their fairness.
