In this case, the issue was with a provider. The users will usually be able to access the site and initiate a deposit, but their deposits will be rejected in the transaction history because the provider flagged their Ontario IP address. In a situation where the provider flags the IP address as Ontario, whitelisting won't help, so it was the correct course of action to advise a change in the connection. <br><br>The user managed to deposit the funds successfully, so our assistance was great. 👌</div></div>",
